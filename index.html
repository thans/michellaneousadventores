                    <p>We departed Seattle around 7:00 PM and caught a ride with my parents on their way back to Bellingham from a wedding in California.</p>
                    <p>In Bellingham, we were greeted by my grandma Nanny Kenny visiting from Newfoundland, and my uncle Fabe visiting from Victoria. We enjoyed a beautiful sunset with some Strawberry Shortcake. We also got to witness Nanny Kenny demo her new e-cigarette she is trying out to help her quit smoking! Go Nan!</p>

                    <h2>The coolest guys in the coolest places</h2>
                    <h3>Vancouver to Toronto | June 16, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Thank you George for the ride to the airport! Most of the day disappeared to our 4 hour flight (on a 777!) and 3 hour time change, but we still snuck in some fun-tivities for the night.</p>
                    <p>Mitch’s cousin Kate met us at the airport and helped us navigate the local transit system back to her apartment where we would be staying.  It was a tight fit – Kate and her husband VJ have been squeezing folks in recently.  So between Kate, VJ, Kate’s mom and dad (Mary Lee and Rick), Mitch and myself, the 2 bedroom loft was full.  It was fun to camp out for a few nights and meet some of Mitch’s family – they might not agree after tip toeing around us every morning while we slept in, but I enjoyed it.</p>
                    <p>When we were finally settled in it was approaching dinner time.  Where else would we go for dinner than the <a href="http://www.vogue.com/slideshow/1080625/fifteen-coolest-street-style-neighborhoods/">2nd coolest neighborhood in the world</a>?  Speaking of cool neighborhoods, you might notice that Södermalm, Stockholm is on that list.  When I was studying in Sweden last fall, I spent my fair share of time in Södermalm, so I must be pretty cool by now!  I would probably rank Södermalm above West Queen in coolness, but maybe I’m just not cool enough for either.</p>
                    <p>Even though things are now measured in meters and liters, we still found some great barbecue for dinner! We ate at the 'ole <a href="http://smoquenbones.com/">Smoque N Bones</a>.  Honestly I was shocked to have such good barbecue in Canada.  I could only imagine good barbecue coming from Kansas City or Texas, but I suppose a big city like Toronto and a cool area like West Queen Ave have a little bit of everything.</p>
                    <p>To cap off the night, Kate, Mitch and I caught a late night showing of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/">Mad Max</a>, which Mitch ranked an 8/10 and was quite an intense start to our trip!</p>

                    <h2>On Top of the World</h2>
                    <h3>Toronto Day 1 | June 17, 2015</h3>
                    <p>We had a late night, so we slept in today until 11:00 AM. We had a small breakfast and took our time getting ready for the day. The weather was a nice 18 degrees with about 30% humidity; perfect shorts weather! Mary Lee, Rick, Tore, and I bussed down Duffrien Ave to Queen's St and met Ian and Aron at <a href="http://queen.terroni.com/">Terroni</a> Italian restaurant. The food was excellent!</p>
                    <p>For those of you reading who do not know, my cousin Ian collapsed and had to be revived by his wife Aron and the paramedics approximately 4 weeks ago. This was at about the same time as Tore and I were making our plans to come to Toronto. I did not know if we would be visiting Ian in the hospital or if he would even be recognizable as the cousin I have grown up knowing! However, Ian has made a miraculous recovery! He has clearly lost a lot of weight, has bloodshot eyes, and a very sore throat as result of the ventilator and the withdrawal from the medication he was on. But Ian was able to enjoy a meal with us and seemed mentally back to his usual self! Amazing!</p>
                    <p>At about 3:00 PM Tore and I separated from the group and headed to the heart of downtown: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower">CN Tower</a>. At 1,815 ft tall, it is the tallest building in the western hemisphere (the Space Needle is 605 ft). Kate told us about the option to walk around the outside of the tower so in the spirit of being "Bud Light" (or "Up for whatever happens"), we decided to do it. We suited up in red jump suits and harnesses and our guide Justin brought us up 1,100 ft to the top of the observation deck and led us outside. With the harnesses securing us to the tower, we leaned out over the edge of the tower. Between my legs, I could look all the way to the ground below and into Rogers Centre at the Blue Jays warming up! It was thrilling! The view around us was also incredible. It was a super clear day, so we could see all the way across Lake Ontario to Niagara Falls and the USA.</p>
                    <p>The next stop was to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonge-Dundas_Square">Yonge-Dundas Square</a> which is Toronto's equivalent to Time Square. It was full of activity and fancy billboards.</p>
                    <p>I could not let Tore leave Canada without experiencing poutine. So in the "But Light" spirit, we headed to BlogTO's top rated Poutine spot: <a href="http://nnncrepes.com/">Nom Nom Nom Crepes</a>. The poutine was delicious. Certainly the best poutine I have had in my Canadian travels! We wanted to also score crepes for dessert, but the food truck had shutdown for the night by the time we were ready for the next course. Instead we walked to <a href="http://www.cafecrepe.com/">Cafe Crepe</a> and I ended up with chocolate all over my face and clothes while eating my Nutella, strawberry, and banana crepe. Worth it!</p>
                    <p>We successfully navigated the Toronto metro system by ourselves and arrived back at Kate and VJ's with time to relax before bed. All-in-all, it was a great day!</p>

                  <h2>Go Blue Jays!</h2>
                  <h3>Toronto | June 18, 2015</h3>
                  <p>Today I felt like we skipped right to the New York part of the trip.  Let me explain – one of my goals for New York was to get the traditional deli experience that you always see in movies.  We ended up eating lunch at <a href="http://www.caplanskys.com/">Caplansky's Deli</a> with Rick, Mary Lee, and Ian – hence the fast forward effect!  I had a poutine like dish – gravy, sausage and other meats (ham and turkey I think?) over challah with fries on the side.  The best part? It was called “The Honest Lawyer!”</p>
                  <p>We followed up lunch with a trip to The Hockey Hall of Fame - a must visit for hockey fans in Toronto. In addition to jerseys from every player inducted into the hall of fame, there was a trophy room with the original Stanley Cup and a replica of the current cup. Mitch and I even snuck in a period of NHL 2015 (for PlayStation) right before they closed.  Since we are recently graduated computer engineers, we took the chance to interact with the various computer installations in the museum.  Much to our delight, we were able to elicit some wonderful error messages simply by touching some of the touchscreens!  They might need to hire us to fix a few things for them…</p>
                  <p>We finished the night with a Blue Jays game – and a big victory!   The combined starting age of the pitchers was over 80 years old! I have never been to a baseball game where they sang the Canadian National Athem at the beginning – but because the Mets were in town, they also played the Star Spangled Banner.  It was quite an entertaining game, though I supposed it is always fun when you are winning.  Even though concessions prices are inflated at sporting events, Mitch and I leveraged the strength of the dollar for a classic dog at the ball park.</p>

                    <h2>Just a Hop, Skip, and a Jump</h2>
                    <h3>Toronto to Washington D.C. | June 19, 2015</h3>
                    <p>I bolted awake this morning at 9:30 to a fire alarm test throughout the condo complex. Once the adrenaline rush subsided, Tore and I got ready to fly out of Toronto to D.C. But before we could leave <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_North">The Great White North</a>, we had to visit one more place: <a href="http://www.timhortons.com/us/en/index.php">Tim Hortons</a>. Kate and VJ graciously drove us to the nearest Timmy's (where we got breakfast sandwiches, Iced Caps, and Timbits) and then to the airport.</p>
                    <p>We flew into Toronto at the big international airport far from downtown, but our flight to D.C. was out of <a href="http://www.portstoronto.com/airport.aspx">Billy Bishop</a> airport which is on <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Toronto+Island">Toronto Island</a> right next to downtown (we even watched planes landing there from the CN Tower). To get to the airport, you have take the world's shortest ferry ride. It is a 400 ft ride across a narrow channel. We flew on <a href="https://www.flyporter.com/Flight?culture=en-CA">Porter Airlines</a>, and Porter has a lounge in the airport with free refreshments!</p>
                    <p>The hour long flight was easy. When we landed we took the Silver Express bus to the gray metro to the green metro, and arrived at the place we booked through <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnb</a>. The 90 degree heat and 60%+ humidity were devastating. Sweat immediately flowed from our pores. The weather is going to be challenging here in D.C.! Tore and I fought through it and took the metro to meet up with my good friend Ellie Larson for dinner at <a href="http://www.goodstuffeatery.com/">Good Stuff Eatery</a>. The burgers were great and so was the conversation!</p>
                    <p>Just before getting home, Tore and I discovered several fireflys glowing in the air. It was the first time I had ever seen the amazing spectacle!</p>

                    <h2>Sunburned and Rain soaked</h2>
                    <h3>Washington DC | June 20, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Yes, Mom, I didn’t put sunscreen on.  Yes, you can have an “I told you so.”  But I still had a blast today!</p>
                    <p>Today was our big museum and monument day in DC.  We will probably have more than one of those, so I guess I should say it was our first.  Boy did we start out strong.  We met up with Ellie and her friend Sarah at the Washington Monument – you know, the massive obelisk.  Ellie and Sarah had gotten 2 tickets from some nice strangers to go to the top of the memorial (Mitch and I had jokingly told them that we were at the top of it already, not realizing that it was actually possible).  2 tickets for 4 people would have meant we would split up – until we got another ticket from someone else who had an extra, and the rangers overheard us and let all 4 of us go with 3 tickets anyway.</p>
                    <p>What a view from the top!  From one side, you can see the Lincoln Memorial, from another the White House, from a third side you can see the Capitol building, and finally from the last side you can see the Jefferson Memorial.  After soaking in the view, we took the elevators back down, only to discover that what I had thought were purely plain stone blocks were anything but.  It turns out that each state has donated a custom block to the memorial – and that is the only way blocks are added.  They were all intricately chiseled, and some were made out of materials common in that state.  This would prove to be a recurring theme in each of the memorials we saw – I never realized how much the states (and even territories) would be recognized on national monuments.</p>
                    <p>But I should stop there.  At this point it seems like the sun is out and nobody is sunburned (yet) and everyone is giving us tickets to memorials and life is good – right?  WRONG.  I forgot to mention that there is construction…everywhere.  The capitol building?  Under construction.  And not just the building itself, but a few blocks leading up to it.  The Lincoln Memorial?  Under construction.  Even the monument is surrounded by orange cones and fences.  What about our view from the top?  Well it is true you can see all of those things, and it almost helps us see over the construction in some cases.  But there really are fenced off areas everywhere.  Rather than fight it, we decied to embrace it and pose next to every construction sign we could find.</p>

                    <h3>Washington DC | June 20, 2015 (continued)</h3>
                    <p>Just kidding!  There is some construction going on, so we decided to make it look like there was construction in as many places as possible.  In reality, it is not that bad.  Anyway, back to the real story.</p>
                    <p>After the Washington monument, we went to my favorite memorial of the day – the World War II memorial.  I had no idea there was a WWII memorial in DC, but as soon as I heard about it I knew we had to go.  You see, in my travels over the past year, I visited as many WWII related sites and museums as possible.  From Pearl Harbor to museums in Norway and Austria to concentration camps in the Czech Republic, I have been at sites which span a good portion of the war just this year.</p>
                    <p>As we approached the memorial, chills ran down my spine.  There is a fountain and large pool in the middle, and it is surrounded by pillars arranged in a military banquet fashion, each one representing a state or territory of the US from 1940-1945.  On the East side of the memorial is a dedication to those who fought in the Atlantic, which the West side mirrors with a dedication to those who fought in the Pacific.  I spoke with one of the park rangers about the memorial, and she said it was intended to be a place of celebration, in contrast to the somber memorials to the Korean and Vietnam wars just a few hundred yards away.  I was truly touched by this memorial, its dedication to all who fought and specifically those who lost their lives, and the spirit of celebration in the fountains and motivational quotes inscribed all around.</p>
                    <p>I would hate to bore you with more talk of WWII and all that we packed in to the day, so in short, we went to the Holocaust Museum (and got a fairly complete history of WWII - a perfect complement to the memorial) and the White House.  But one last story from the day.</p>
                    <p>As suggested by Emily Chin, we went to Kramerbooks, a book store, coffee shop, bar, restaurant combo for some pie.  As we ate, it started raining and hailing, but by the time we finished the skies had calmed.  We took the metro back to the stop by our place, only to run into a massive thunder storm - so massive we would soon be getting flash flood warnings on our phones!  Luckily there is a Safeway by the metro and I needed to grab a few things, so we ran inside to wait it out.  After waiting at least a half hour, the rain had died down (but was still much heavier than a rainy day in Seattle), so we decided to walk home.  We got soaked.  Completely drenched.  But, as luck would have it, at least the power was out when we got home...oh wait, that wasn't convenient at all.  But that's the nature of travelling!  It gave me time to share this all with you, and as soon as the power was back online, we were able to post our website!</p>
