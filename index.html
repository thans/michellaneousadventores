                    <p>We departed Seattle around 7:00 PM and caught a ride with my parents on their way back to Bellingham from a wedding in California.</p>
                    <p>In Bellingham, we were greeted by my grandma Nanny Kenny visiting from Newfoundland, and my uncle Fabe visiting from Victoria. We enjoyed a beautiful sunset with some Strawberry Shortcake. We also got to witness Nanny Kenny demo her new e-cigarette she is trying out to help her quit smoking! Go Nan!</p>

                    <p>Thank you George for the ride to the airport!  Most of the day disappeared to our 4 hour flight (on a 777!) and 3 hour time change, but we still snuck in some fun-tivities for the night.</p>
                    <p>Even though things are now measured in meters and liters, we still found some great barbecue for dinner! We ate at the 'ole <a href="http://smoquenbones.com/">Smoque N Bones</a> (which is in <a href="http://www.vogue.com/slideshow/1080625/fifteen-coolest-street-style-neighborhoods/">the second coolest neighboorhood in the world</a>.  You might notice the #3 neighborhood is SÃ¶dermalm in Stockholm, where I studied last fall.  So I guess that means I'm pretty cool at this point) for dinner with Kate (Mitch's cousin), Rick, and Mary Lee (Kate's parents).  Then Kate, Mitch and I caught a late night showing of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/">Mad Max</a> - an intense start to our trip!</p>
                    <p>Thanks to Kate and her husband VJ, Mitch and I get to start off the trip by staying with family - well, his family that is!</p>

                    <h2>On Top of the World</h2>
                    <h3>Toronto Day 1 | June 17, 2015</h3>
                    <p>We had a late night, so we slept in today until 11:00 AM. We had a small breakfast and took our time getting ready for the day. The weather was a nice 18 degrees with about 30% humidity; perfect shorts weather! Mary Lee, Rick, Tore, and I bussed down Duffrien Ave to Queen's St and met Ian and Aron at <a href="http://queen.terroni.com/">Terroni</a> Italian restaurant. The food was excellent!</p>
                    <p>For those of you reading who do not know, my cousin Ian collapsed and had to be revived by his wife Aron and the paramedics approximately 4 weeks ago. This was at about the same time as Tore and I were making our plans to come to Toronto. I did not know if we would be visiting Ian in the hospital or if he would even be recognizable as the cousin I have grown up knowing! However, Ian has made a miraculous recovery! He has clearly lost a lot of weight, has bloodshot eyes, and a very sore throat as result of the ventilator and the withdrawal from the medication he was on. But Ian was able to enjoy a meal with us and seemed mentally back to his usual self! Amazing!</p>
                    <p>At about 3:00 PM Tore and I separated from the group and headed to the heart of downtown: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower">CN Tower</a>. At 1,815 ft tall, it is the tallest building in the western hemisphere (the Space Needle is 605 ft). Kate told us about the option to walk around the outside of the tower so in the spirit of being "Bud Light" (or "Up for whatever happens"), we decided to do it. We suited up in red jump suits and harnesses and our guide Justin brought us up 1,100 ft to the top of the observation deck and led us outside. With the harnesses securing us to the tower, we leaned out over the edge of the tower. Between my legs, I could look all the way to the ground below and into Rogers Centre at the Blue Jays warming up! It was thrilling! The view around us was also incredible. It was a super clear day, so we could see all the way across Lake Ontario to Niagara Falls and the USA.</p>
                    <p>The next stop was to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonge-Dundas_Square">Yonge-Dundas Square</a> which is Toronto's equivalent to Time Square. It was full of activity and fancy billboards.</p>
                    <p>I could not let Tore leave Canada without experiencing poutine. So in the "But Light" spirit, we headed to BlogTO's top rated Poutine spot: <a href="http://nnncrepes.com/">Nom Nom Nom Crepes</a>. The poutine was delicious. Certainly the best poutine I have had in my Canadian travels! We wanted to also score crepes for dessert, but the food truck had shutdown for the night by the time we were ready for the next course. Instead we walked to <a href="http://www.cafecrepe.com/">Cafe Crepe</a> and I ended up with chocolate all over my face and clothes while eating my Nutella, strawberry, and banana crepe. Worth it!</p>
                    <p>We successfully navigated the Toronto metro system by ourselves and arrived back at Kate and VJ's with time to relax before bed. All-in-all, it was a great day!</p>

                    <h2>Go Blue Jays!</h2>
                    <h3>Toronto Day 2 | June 17, 2015</h3>
                    <p>Some big highlights from today included lunch at <a href="http://www.caplanskys.com/">Caplansky's Deli</a> (we didn't have to wait until NY for the Deli experience), a trip to the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a 7-1 Blue Jays victory over the Mets!</p>
                    <p>The Hockey Hall of Fame is a must visit for hockey fans in Toronto.  In addition to jerseys from every player inducted into the hall of fame, there was a trophy room with the original Stanley Cup and a replica of the current cup.  They even had a hands on exhibit for you to try shooting at video-game goalie projected on a screen - or you could be the goalie and attempt to block shots from a video-game offense which flung pucks out of the wall at you! Sadly, Mitch and I got to this exhibit at closing time, but we were able to sneak in a period of NHL 2015 on the PlayStations they had.</p>
