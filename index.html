                        <p>We departed Seattle around 7:00 PM and caught a ride with my parents on their way back to Bellingham from a wedding in California.</p>
                        <p>In Bellingham, we were greeted by my grandma Nanny Kenny visiting from Newfoundland, and my uncle Fabe visiting from Victoria. We enjoyed a beautiful sunset with some Strawberry Shortcake. We also got to witness Nanny Kenny demo her new e-cigarette she is trying out to help her quit smoking! Go Nan!</p>

                        <h2>The coolest guys in the coolest places</h2>
                        <h3>Vancouver to Toronto | June 16, 2015</h3>
                        <p>Thank you George for the ride to the airport! Most of the day disappeared to our 4 hour flight (on a 777!) and 3 hour time change, but we still snuck in some fun-tivities for the night.</p>
                        <p>Mitch’s cousin Kate met us at the airport and helped us navigate the local transit system back to her apartment where we would be staying.  It was a tight fit – Kate and her husband VJ have been squeezing folks in recently.  So between Kate, VJ, Kate’s mom and dad (Mary Lee and Rick), Mitch and myself, the 2 bedroom loft was full.  It was fun to camp out for a few nights and meet some of Mitch’s family – they might not agree after tip toeing around us every morning while we slept in, but I enjoyed it.</p>
                        <p>When we were finally settled in it was approaching dinner time.  Where else would we go for dinner than the <a href="http://www.vogue.com/slideshow/1080625/fifteen-coolest-street-style-neighborhoods/">2nd coolest neighborhood in the world</a>?  Speaking of cool neighborhoods, you might notice that Södermalm, Stockholm is on that list.  When I was studying in Sweden last fall, I spent my fair share of time in Södermalm, so I must be pretty cool by now!  I would probably rank Södermalm above West Queen in coolness, but maybe I’m just not cool enough for either.</p>
                        <p>Even though things are now measured in meters and liters, we still found some great barbecue for dinner! We ate at the 'ole <a href="http://smoquenbones.com/">Smoque N Bones</a>.  Honestly I was shocked to have such good barbecue in Canada.  I could only imagine good barbecue coming from Kansas City or Texas, but I suppose a big city like Toronto and a cool area like West Queen Ave have a little bit of everything.</p>
                        <p>To cap off the night, Kate, Mitch and I caught a late night showing of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/">Mad Max</a>, which Mitch ranked an 8/10 and was quite an intense start to our trip!</p>

                        <h2>On Top of the World</h2>
                        <h3>Toronto Day 1 | June 17, 2015</h3>
                        <p>We had a late night, so we slept in today until 11:00 AM. We had a small breakfast and took our time getting ready for the day. The weather was a nice 18 degrees with about 30% humidity; perfect shorts weather! Mary Lee, Rick, Tore, and I bussed down Duffrien Ave to Queen's St and met Ian and Aron at <a href="http://queen.terroni.com/">Terroni</a> Italian restaurant. The food was excellent!</p>
                        <p>For those of you reading who do not know, my cousin Ian collapsed and had to be revived by his wife Aron and the paramedics approximately 4 weeks ago. This was at about the same time as Tore and I were making our plans to come to Toronto. I did not know if we would be visiting Ian in the hospital or if he would even be recognizable as the cousin I have grown up knowing! However, Ian has made a miraculous recovery! He has clearly lost a lot of weight, has bloodshot eyes, and a very sore throat as result of the ventilator and the withdrawal from the medication he was on. But Ian was able to enjoy a meal with us and seemed mentally back to his usual self! Amazing!</p>
                        <p>At about 3:00 PM Tore and I separated from the group and headed to the heart of downtown: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower">CN Tower</a>. At 1,815 ft tall, it is the tallest building in the western hemisphere (the Space Needle is 605 ft). Kate told us about the option to walk around the outside of the tower so in the spirit of being "Bud Light" (or "Up for whatever happens"), we decided to do it. We suited up in red jump suits and harnesses and our guide Justin brought us up 1,100 ft to the top of the observation deck and led us outside. With the harnesses securing us to the tower, we leaned out over the edge of the tower. Between my legs, I could look all the way to the ground below and into Rogers Centre at the Blue Jays warming up! It was thrilling! The view around us was also incredible. It was a super clear day, so we could see all the way across Lake Ontario to Niagara Falls and the USA.</p>
                        <p>The next stop was to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonge-Dundas_Square">Yonge-Dundas Square</a> which is Toronto's equivalent to Time Square. It was full of activity and fancy billboards.</p>
                        <p>I could not let Tore leave Canada without experiencing poutine. So in the "But Light" spirit, we headed to BlogTO's top rated Poutine spot: <a href="http://nnncrepes.com/">Nom Nom Nom Crepes</a>. The poutine was delicious. Certainly the best poutine I have had in my Canadian travels! We wanted to also score crepes for dessert, but the food truck had shutdown for the night by the time we were ready for the next course. Instead we walked to <a href="http://www.cafecrepe.com/">Cafe Crepe</a> and I ended up with chocolate all over my face and clothes while eating my Nutella, strawberry, and banana crepe. Worth it!</p>
                        <p>We successfully navigated the Toronto metro system by ourselves and arrived back at Kate and VJ's with time to relax before bed. All-in-all, it was a great day!</p>

                        <h2>Go Blue Jays!</h2>
                        <h3>Toronto Day 2 | June 18, 2015</h3>
                        <p>Today I felt like we skipped right to the New York part of the trip.  Let me explain – one of my goals for New York was to get the traditional deli experience that you always see in movies.  We ended up eating lunch at <a href="http://www.caplanskys.com/">Caplansky's Deli</a> with Rick, Mary Lee, and Ian – hence the fast forward effect!  I had a poutine like dish – gravy, sausage and other meats (ham and turkey I think?) over challah with fries on the side.  The best part? It was called “The Honest Lawyer!”</p>
                        <p>We followed up lunch with a trip to The Hockey Hall of Fame - a must visit for hockey fans in Toronto. In addition to jerseys from every player inducted into the hall of fame, there was a trophy room with the original Stanley Cup and a replica of the current cup. Mitch and I even snuck in a period of NHL 2015 (for PlayStation) right before they closed.  Since we are recently graduated computer engineers, we took the chance to interact with the various computer installations in the museum.  Much to our delight, we were able to elicit some wonderful error messages simply by touching some of the touchscreens!  They might need to hire us to fix a few things for them…</p>
                        <p>We finished the night with a Blue Jays game – and a big victory!   The combined starting age of the pitchers was over 80 years old! I have never been to a baseball game where they sang the Canadian National Athem at the beginning – but because the Mets were in town, they also played the Star Spangled Banner.  It was quite an entertaining game, though I supposed it is always fun when you are winning.  Even though concessions prices are inflated at sporting events, Mitch and I leveraged the strength of the dollar for a classic dog at the ball park.</p>

                        <h2>Just a Hop, Skip, and a Jump</h2>
                        <h3>Toronto to Washington D.C. | June 19, 2015</h3>
                        <p>I bolted awake this morning at 9:30 to a fire alarm test throughout the condo complex. Once the adrenaline rush subsided, Tore and I got ready to fly out of Toronto to D.C. But before we could leave <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_North">The Great White North</a>, we had to visit one more place: <a href="http://www.timhortons.com/us/en/index.php">Tim Hortons</a>. Kate and VJ graciously drove us to the nearest Timmy's (where we got breakfast sandwiches, Iced Caps, and Timbits) and then to the airport.</p>
                        <p>We flew into Toronto at the big international airport far from downtown, but our flight to D.C. was out of <a href="http://www.portstoronto.com/airport.aspx">Billy Bishop</a> airport which is on <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Toronto+Island">Toronto Island</a> right next to downtown (we even watched planes landing there from the CN Tower). To get to the airport, you have take the world's shortest ferry ride. It is a 400 ft ride across a narrow channel. We flew on <a href="https://www.flyporter.com/Flight?culture=en-CA">Porter Airlines</a>, and Porter has a lounge in the airport with free refreshments!</p>
                        <p>The hour long flight was easy. When we landed we took the Silver Express bus to the gray metro to the green metro, and arrived at the place we booked through <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnb</a>. The 90 degree heat and 60%+ humidity were devastating. Sweat immediately flowed from our pores. The weather is going to be challenging here in D.C.! Tore and I fought through it and took the metro to meet up with my good friend Ellie Larson for dinner at <a href="http://www.goodstuffeatery.com/">Good Stuff Eatery</a>. The burgers were great and so was the conversation!</p>
                        <p>Just before getting home, Tore and I discovered several fireflys glowing in the air. It was the first time I had ever seen the amazing spectacle!</p>

                        <h2>Sunburned and Rain soaked</h2>
                        <h3>Washington DC Day 1 | June 20, 2015</h3>
                        <p>Yes, Mom, I didn’t put sunscreen on.  Yes, you can have an “I told you so.”  But I still had a blast today!</p>
                        <p>Today was our big museum and monument day in DC.  We will probably have more than one of those, so I guess I should say it was our first.  Boy did we start out strong.  We met up with Ellie and her friend Sarah at the Washington Monument – you know, the massive obelisk.  Ellie and Sarah had gotten 2 tickets from some nice strangers to go to the top of the memorial (Mitch and I had jokingly told them that we were at the top of it already, not realizing that it was actually possible).  2 tickets for 4 people would have meant we would split up – until we got another ticket from someone else who had an extra, and the rangers overheard us and let all 4 of us go with 3 tickets anyway.</p>
                        <p>What a view from the top!  From one side, you can see the Lincoln Memorial, from another the White House, from a third side you can see the Capitol building, and finally from the last side you can see the Jefferson Memorial.  After soaking in the view, we took the elevators back down, only to discover that what I had thought were purely plain stone blocks were anything but.  It turns out that each state has donated a custom block to the memorial – and that is the only way blocks are added.  They were all intricately chiseled, and some were made out of materials common in that state.  This would prove to be a recurring theme in each of the memorials we saw – I never realized how much the states (and even territories) would be recognized on national monuments.</p>
                        <p>But I should stop there.  At this point it seems like the sun is out and nobody is sunburned (yet) and everyone is giving us tickets to memorials and life is good – right?  WRONG.  I forgot to mention that there is construction…everywhere.  The capitol building?  Under construction.  And not just the building itself, but a few blocks leading up to it.  The Lincoln Memorial?  Under construction.  Even the monument is surrounded by orange cones and fences.  What about our view from the top?  Well it is true you can see all of those things, and it almost helps us see over the construction in some cases.  But there really are fenced off areas everywhere.  Rather than fight it, we decied to embrace it and pose next to every construction sign we could find.</p>

                        <h3>Washington DC Day 1 | June 20, 2015 (continued)</h3>
                        <p>Just kidding!  There is some construction going on, so we decided to make it look like there was construction in as many places as possible.  In reality, it is not that bad.  Anyway, back to the real story.</p>
                        <p>After the Washington monument, we went to my favorite memorial of the day – the World War II memorial.  I had no idea there was a WWII memorial in DC, but as soon as I heard about it I knew we had to go.  You see, in my travels over the past year, I visited as many WWII related sites and museums as possible.  From Pearl Harbor to museums in Norway and Austria to concentration camps in the Czech Republic, I have been at sites which span a good portion of the war just this year.</p>
                        <p>As we approached the memorial, chills ran down my spine.  There is a fountain and large pool in the middle, and it is surrounded by pillars arranged in a military banquet fashion, each one representing a state or territory of the US from 1940-1945.  On the East side of the memorial is a dedication to those who fought in the Atlantic, which the West side mirrors with a dedication to those who fought in the Pacific.  I spoke with one of the park rangers about the memorial, and she said it was intended to be a place of celebration, in contrast to the somber memorials to the Korean and Vietnam wars just a few hundred yards away.  I was truly touched by this memorial, its dedication to all who fought and specifically those who lost their lives, and the spirit of celebration in the fountains and motivational quotes inscribed all around.</p>
                        <p>I would hate to bore you with more talk of WWII and all that we packed in to the day, so in short, we went to the Holocaust Museum (and got a fairly complete history of WWII - a perfect complement to the memorial) and the White House.  But one last story from the day.</p>
                        <p>As suggested by Emily Chin, we went to Kramerbooks, a book store, coffee shop, bar, restaurant combo for some pie.  As we ate, it started raining and hailing, but by the time we finished the skies had calmed.  We took the metro back to the stop by our place, only to run into a massive thunder storm - so massive we would soon be getting flash flood warnings on our phones!  Luckily there is a Safeway by the metro and I needed to grab a few things, so we ran inside to wait it out.  After waiting at least a half hour, the rain had died down (but was still much heavier than a rainy day in Seattle), so we decided to walk home.  We got soaked.  Completely drenched.  But, as luck would have it, at least the power was out when we got home...oh wait, that wasn't convenient at all.  But that's the nature of travelling!  It gave me time to share this all with you, and as soon as the power was back online, we were able to post our website!</p>
                        <p> - Tore QP (if they can add 2 letters after Washington, I get 2 after my name!)</p>

                        <h2>Tired and Hungry</h2>
                        <h3>Washington D.C. Day 2 | June 21, 2015</h3>
                        <p>I unscrewed the lightblub from our ceiling fan so we could sleep with the fan on last night, and it made sleeping much better. Tore and I ate our <a href="http://postfoods.com/our-brands/honey-bunches-of-oats?gclid=CLXIr5GoosYCFUUUHwod53QFFQ&gclsrc=aw.ds">Honey Bunches of Oats</a> and went north on the metro to meet Ellie and Sarah at the <a href="http://www.thecitydc.org/">Washington D.C. City Church</a>. This was particularly interesting because the original church started in Kirkland, WA and I have gone to the U-District campus with Melanie a few times. During the service they brought out bacon covered doughnuts for the fathers in the congregation; I was thinking it might be worth having kids just for the free doughnut!</p>
                        <p>We said goodbye to Ellie and Sarah and headed for the <a href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/">Arlington Cemetery</a>. Despite walking over a mile, we saw only a fraction of the >400,000 grave stones of the military service members buried there. We witnessed the "Changing of the Guard" where the soldier ceremoniously marching by the <a href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Explore-the-Cemetery/Tomb-of-the-Unknown-Soldier">Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</a> is replaced by a new guard. There were very clear wear marks in the granite from where the soldiers have been precisely marching every hour for decades.</p>
                        <p>Desperate for some lunch, we meandered to L'Enfant Plaza where Google Maps assured us there would be lots of food options. But we forgot to read the hours of operation and discovered a region of D.C. completely deserted on the weekend. We got back on the metro and went to the first restaurant we could find: <a href="http://districtchophouse.com/">District ChopHouse and Brewery</a>.</p>
                        <p>Revitalized, we went to the <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/">Smithsonian Air and Space Museum</a>. It was full of incredible exhibits. We watched an IMAX video <a href="http://www.si.edu/imax/movie/161">Living in the Age of Airplanes</a> and in the planetarium we watched <a href="http://www.si.edu/imax/movie/131">Dark Universe</a>. Dark Universe had some very interesting information about what we know about the edge of our universe, but Tore only caught the first 5 minutes before the comfy chairs got to him.</p>
                        <p>We walked out to discover over 30 police cars blocking the street across from us and news reporters interviewing people, but nobody could explain what was happening. After it died down, we were hungry again and ready for any food option, and McDonalds was what appeared. Not the most authentic D.C. option, but the $1 any size drink deal was too good to pass up on such a hot day. No rain today, but my phone said "91 degrees (feels like 97)."</p>

                        <h2>Lazy Monday</h2>
                        <h3>Washington D.C. Day 3 | June 22, 2015</h3>
                        <p>Wakey Wakey!  We skipped over lazy sunday and slept right through until noon for a lazy monday (and final day) in DC.  It was nice to not have to worry about getting up, but we ended up hitting the town during the peak hours of heat.  Weather Underground was happy to inform us that is was a balmy 96, but felt like 107!</p>
                        <p>We started out with little to no plan, and ended up with a full day! Until today we had only seen the Capitol building from a distance, so we decided that was a must see.  We started off across the street from the Capitol building at the Library of Congress.  WOW! I had no idea such a building existed in this country.  Inspired by Italian architecture, the entrance to the library was simply stunning.  We wandered around the exhibits and made our way to a balcony for a view over the reading room where researchers were at work - as much as I love the Suzzalo Reading Room at UW, this place was incredible.  The high arching ceiling hung above the beautiful wooden desks around the room, and we could even see part of the way into the various caverns off the main room where books lined the walls.  By the end I found myself asking Mitch what kind of minimum qualifications we might need to get in - "Uh...how about a janitor?" he replied.</p>
                        <p>After exploring as much as we could at the Library of Congress, we made our way to the Capitol building.  Tours were free and one started just minutes after we got there, so we tagged along.  I had forgotten that the capitol building was burned down in the war of 1812, but they sure did remake it into a building worthy of housing congress!  The tour took us through the <a href="http://www.aoc.gov/capitol-buildings/national-statuary-hall">National Sanctuary Hall</a>, the part under the dome (which is currently under construction!  Classic DC), past Speaker Boehner's office, and into the room that used to house the Senate (which is now filled with statues).  Apparently, they needed something to go in this room, so congress passed a law that each state had to (or only got to?) provide 2 statues to the capitol.  But the room can't hold 100 statues so they are now scattered about the capitol building.  But the states have to choose carefully - they can only change a statue out after it has been there for 10 years!  Most of them were pretty well known figures and former presidents, like Reagan, Jefferson, etc.  The last stop on the tour was the crypt - apparently George Washington was going to be burried under the capitol building but the tomb was not ready in time!  So for next time, a trip to Mount Vernon!</p>
                        <p>One last thing that stood out to both Mitch and myself - the painting showing <a href="http://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/historic-rotunda-paintings/general-george-washington-resigning-his-commission">George Washington resigning his commision as general</a>.  Unbelievable!  That just does not happen.  At least from what I see today, or the struggle of dictators to maintain their power.  What a guy.  He was definitely portrayed as a God throughout the Capitol building - but he really was a special man.</p>
                        <p>Dinner was definitely another highlight for me.  We decided to go to Chinatown for one of our last meals here, but the places we saw didn't quite interest us at first.  That is, until we saw <a href="http://www.nandosperiperi.com/">Peri Peri</a>.  I'm still a little confused about what this place is (I thought it would be African, the hostess said it was Portuguese or at least Portuguese style), but we had delicious chicken wings!</p>
                        <p>Believe it or not, we squeezed one more thing in - a trip to <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g30242-d618397-Reviews-Gravelly_Point_Park-Arlington_Virginia.html">Gravely Point Park</a>, where you can watch planes fly over you and land at Ronald Reagan Airport.  Watch out for some cool videos from this place!</p>
                        <p>DC was fun, but I hope we can avoid the heat a little more on our next stops.</p>

                        <h2>Delay After Delay</h2>
                        <h3>Washington D.C. to Philadelphia | June 23, 2015</h3>
                        <p>"We have two stops to go and our connecting metro train leaves in 3 minutes." Not what we wanted to hear. My decision to sleep in as late as possible had already put us a train behind at our first connection. We had to be at the bus station by 10:35 AM and Google Maps said we would arrive at 10:30 AM (assuming we caught our next connection). We could hear the next train arriving above us as we exited the first train and booked it to the escalators. But it was in vain. We missed our connection. The next train was not for over 10 minutes and it was too far to walk or run. We concluded our only option was to get above ground and grab a taxi. Our driver got us as close as possible to the Megabus loading zone at Union Station. We actually followed the bus into the station! Phew! The bus was pretty warm and smelled a like a porta-potty, but at $23 it was still a better option than a $100+ Amtrak ticket.</p>
                        <p>I slept a decent amount of the drive and woke up as we were getting into Philly. As we got off the freeway, there was a peculiar intersection where a man driving a black Audi thought he could turn right, but that was across the freeway exit. The bus driver slammed on the brakes, but we smashed right into the side of the car. We pulled over and when the bus driver asked if everyone was OK, some people started half faking injury (the collision was hardly felt in the bus). One woman asked who was at fault, and when Tore and I told her it was the other driver, she too started talking about feeling something in her neck. The fortunate part was that we crashed about 100 ft from the station so we exited the bus and were on our way.</p>
                        <p>We waited in the station for Alex (Tore's cousin) to come show us around Philly. Meanwhile, Tore and I split a Cinnabon and stored our bags in the station. To store our bags in the station, we needed an Amtrak ticket so we bought the cheapest ticket we could! We walked around the station and noticed that the bus and Audi were still outside an hour later.</p>
                        <p>When Alex arrived, we went to see the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall (where the Deceleration of Independence was signed). It was amazing to see how the Liberty Bell has been a symbol for so many pursuits of liberty over its history (first with the religious freedom of the Pennsylvania colony, then the American Independence, anti-slavery, civil rights, and even international pursuits of liberty).</p>
                        <p>Then Alex took us to get Philly Cheese Steaks. There are two famous spots across an intersection from each other: Pat's and Gino's. We ordered a "Wiz Wit" (with Cheese Wiz and onions) from each location to be able to experience them both. It was a massive quantity to eat, but we all finished our two foot-long sized sandwiches.</p>
                        <p>We got back to the bus/train station to find the bus still on the side of the road outside. We boarded a train back to Tore's relatives' house. On the way, a big thunderstorm rolled in. This caused the train to loose power multiple times and deplayed us about an hour (great time for a nap!)</p>
                        <p>The Hanssen's were very welcoming! We enjoyed chatting an hanging out on their back porch with tons of fireflies twinkling all around. While Tore had a few beers, I accepted an offer for some Root Beer. I took a small sip and thought, "that's not right." To the surprise of us all, it had a 5.9% alcohol content. It was a good laugh, but I let others enjoy it instead!</p>
                        <p>Special thanks to the Hanssens for letting us crash and giving us a taste of PA! Off to New York tomorrow!</p>

                        <h2>Go Big (Apple) or Go Home</h2>
                        <h3>Philadelphia to New York | June 24, 2015</h3>
                        <p>It was so nice to see Tore, Lisa, Alex, and Elise!  When we were planning the trip, I told Mitch that if we were going to be in the area I wanted to stop to see my family, and I am so glad we got the opportunity.  It was nice to swap fishing stories with Tore and talk about Crystal Falls (where the Hanssen's have vactioned in the summer for decades)!</p>
                        <p>This morning we didn't have any issues with the trains or busses - Lisa dropped us off at the train station in New Jersey and we hopped aboard for a short trip into New York.  We had a little time before we could get in to our airbnb place, so we decided to go big and start with seeing the statue of liberty.  Just walking down the streets to get to the ferry you can feel how big this city is.  And the taxi cabs!  I think I was prepared for the tall buildings, but nothing could prepare me for the number of taxi cabs!  I couldn't stop thinking "The yellow ones don't stop" (from Elf), especially when all the cars would just sit on crosswalks like they weren't even there.  Not only are there just a lot of people and cars, but everyone seems to love honking their horns.  Mitch and I decided we need to invest in some air horns so we can honk back - we will have to pick some up with Amazon Prime Now (1 hour shipping in New York)!</p>
                        <p>Another big thing both Mitch and I noticed was the number of languages we have heard - obviously, on the Staten Island Ferry which many tourists take to get a view of the Statue of Liberty there were a number of different countries represented, but I also noticed it from people walking around who seemed to be locals and even a group of NYPD officers.  Something else surprising for me - the city seems surprisingly affordable for housing.  I expected levels higher than, say, San Francisco, which I am certain you can find in the right places.  But I found some nice looking apartments a few blocks from central park that are about as expensive as living in downtown Seattle.  Not cheap, by any means, but more affordable than I had expected.</p>
                        <p>When it finally came time to move in to our airbnb place, we grabbed our bags from storage (which we paid $10/bag for!) and took the metro to the "Hell's Kitchen" area where we would be staying.  Mitch plugged in the address and we followed google maps at first, but then started to question where it was leading us.  We saw a building that was in the airbnb listing we had purchased and it was a few blocks away from where google maps was leading us.  We decided to trust google for now, and found the building, but things really did not feel right - I started to wonder about what you do if your airbnb place is not as described, or if we were being led somewhere we did not want to go.  We carried our bags up 5 flights of stairs and met our host - he acted completely normal, but the apartment looked NOTHING like the pictures.  No balcony, 5th floor was no where near high enough to get the view we expected, the kitchen was noticably smaller, the bathroom was no where near as nice, and the bedroom just looked wrong.  We got the keys and waited for the host to leave and then both started saying "This is not the right place!"  So Mitch dug out his phone and looked at the reservation - "These pictures have changed!  They show this apartment now!"  How could this even be possible?  Would airbnb let you change the pictures?  "Wait, this is the correct address...this is the guy I contacted..."  After doing some more research, it is the place the booking confirmation came from, and everything pointed to this apartment.  So Mitch checked his browsing history, and our best guess is that he opened a lot of tabs of different apartments, we agreed on one, and then he clicked "Reserve" on the wrong one!  These things happen.  Classic user error.  Classic travel adventure.</p>
                        <p>We still had a nice apartment in a great location and we were excited to explore more of the city!  Well, until Mitch couldn't handle the news that we booked the wrong place and decided to nap it off.</p>
                        <p>My good friend Becca is in New York working for Droga5 (an advertising agency), so I made plans with her to meet up for dinner.  I woke Mitch up and we found a great sushi place nearby and chowed down on good food and enjoyed catching up with Becca!  She then had the next "go big" moment of the night - donut ice cream sandwiches!  We got our fill of a couple thousand calories, which we were definitely missing from Philly Cheesesteaks the night before...lets just say food tourism and health don't always work together.  After a short walk through central park, we retired to our apartment (which looked familiar this time) to plan out some activities, and of course, update the blog!</p>
                        <p>So far, I <3 NY</p>

                        <h2>Becoming New Yorkers</h2>
                        <h3>New York Day 1 | June 25, 2015</h3>
                        <p>On September 11th, 2001, the World Trade Centers were destroyed by terrorists, but no matter how hard they try, they will never be able to break the spirit of liberty and justice that defines the United States of America. The new One World Trade Center (Freedom Tower) symbolizes that prevailing spirit.</p>
                        <p>Today Tore and I got up and went to the observation level of the One World Trade Center. It is certainly the best 360 degree view of the city you can get. They also had very cool uses of technology with floor to ceiling screens in the elevators with cool graphics, and 8 screens mounted in a circle around a presenter who could control the content on the screens with a band on his arm. However, all the ways they were trying to get every dollar out of us detracted from the experience a bit (pay for an expedited pass, pay for photos, walk you through the gift shop, pay to rent iPads to point out buildings, etc.).</p>
                        <p>As Tore and I looked over the edge of the fountains located at ground zero, we reflected on how brave the service men and women had to be to go into the burning towers, particularly in the second tower after the first had collapsed. Thanks to their efforts, over 47,000 people (94%) were able to escape the buildings.</p>
                        <p>We then walked over to Wall street to have lunch with Becca at an awesome taco/burrito stand. After we said good bye to Becca, we explored the south east side waterfront.</p>
                        <p>I have worn all my underwear, worn them inside out, worn them backwards, and even gone commando a few days, so Tore and I figured it was time to do some laundry. The thing to do in New York is to take your laundry to a laundromat where they will wash it and fold it for you and you pick it up the next day. Nobody has folded my laundry in 4 years, so that sounded appealing. Hopefully we get our clothes back tomorrow so I do not have to walk around New York naked for the rest of the trip.</p>
                        <p>After a nap, we went to dinner at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Halal-Guys/157700344254837">Halal Guys</a> for street-side Middle Eastern food. It was super good, but way too much food! Fortunately a homeless man was happy to take our extras!</p>
                        <p>To top the night off, we went to a broadway show: <a href="http://www.agentlemansguidebroadway.com/">A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder</a>. It was an excellent comedy musical, and I would highly recommend it! Thanks Becca for the recommendation!</p>

                        <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/C7BakKHwXOg?t=31">Big City</a></h2>
                        <h3>New York Day 2 | June 26, 2015</h3>
                        <p>After another late start, but after collecting our (folded!) laundry, we decided to make our way to the UN building.  We plotted out a route to hit up the major sites on the way - the Rockefeller center, Grand Central Station, and the first lunch spot we stumbled upon.  The Rockefeller center was a nice building and I would love to come back during the Christmas season to go ice skating under the tree the place in front of the building.  Mitch and I also agreed that we loved what John D Rockefeller Jr. stood for - <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/147413-i-believe-in-the-supreme-worth-of-the-individual-and">he was quite a convicted man</a>.  Grand Central Station is quite a bustling place!  We have been having fun playing with timelapse videos (if you can't already tell), and the terminal was a prime spot for some footage!</p>
                        <p><strong>The best bagels I have ever had</strong><br />We trusted Becca's recommendation for the Broadway show last night and that turned out alright, so we trusted her enought to walk a mile somewhat out of the way to go to Ees a bagel.  It was completely worth the walk!  Unfortunately, we hit the end of the lunch rush, so they were out of some things temporarily - but I am so glad I waited the extra 5 minutes for a fresh everything bagel!  Kyle and Eli always make fun of me for liking bagel sandwiches, but these could have turned even the most skeptical of food snobs.  The bagel was soft but kept its form, warm (fresh out of the oven!), and had delicious seasonings on top.  They also had great cream cheese topings - I had to get a strawberry bagel for dessert, while Mitch opted for the raisin walnut cream cheese on a cinnamon raisin bagel - it looked tasty.</p>
                        <p><strong>8 million stories, 1 distinct smell</strong><br />They say New York is the city of 8 million stories, and I don't dispute that.  But the city generally just smells like garbage.  Fortunately there are enough street food vendors to mostly mask the smell with kebab fumes.  We joked about taking a picture every time we smelled the NYC garbage smell - but realized we would just have a picture on every block in the city!</p>
                        <p><strong>Hipsterville</strong><br />Because it was a nice day, we wandered over to the High Line - an old, raised railroad track converted into a park and pedestrian walkway through the Chelsea neighborhood. It felt like a cool part of town, and the walkway was a nice zen garden in the midst of bustling New York City.  I would highly recommend a strong along the High Line to any visitors!  At the end of the walkway there was a city building project - city building with legos that is!  Mitch and I took up the task of representing Seattle by contributing a lego space needle!  We ran out of time at the end as they were closing, but it was coming along quite well.  So well, in fact, that people starting taking pictures of us building it by the end!</p>
                        <p>We decided to go to Times Square and the top of the Rockefeller center at night - we already saw the city during the day from the One World Trade Center, so this seemed like a good compromise. Plus, there wouldn't be as many people at night, right? Wrong.  It was packed.  You had to wait in multiple lines just to get to the top.  And spoiler alert - the view of central park at night is kinda pointless.  It was nice to see the city lit up, but we both agreed the One World Trade Center was a better place to go.  Times Square was quite the spectacle though!  We had been avoiding looking at it during the day to save it for Friday night (whenever we got close, Mitch would say "No peeking!").  A must visit - at least once.  But probably not much more.  It is very commercialized (well, it is a bunch of advertisements, after all!) and lots of people, but good for time lapse videos!</p>

                        <h2>So Many Calories</h2>
                        <h3>New York Day 3 | June 27, 2015</h3>
                        <p>The recent supreme court ruling seemed to have spurred on the display of rainbow colored flags around the city and an increase in gay couples walking around in the city. This encouraged Tore and I to walk a little bit farther apart on the street today. It has already been slightly awkward each time we check into a new place with a single queen bed.</p>
                        <p>I slept in, but Tore got us some mangos to start the day off right! We then subwayed to the iconic triangular, 21 floored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatiron_Building">Flatiron building</a> adjacent to Madison Square Park. In the park is the <a href="https://www.shakeshack.com/location/madison-square-park/">Shake Shack</a> restaurant where we had lunch. I got a delicious burger with bacon and cheese sauce and a coffee shake. Tore had a burger with bacon, cheese, and peppers and a chocolate carmel concrete (milkshake eaten with a spoon).</p>
                        <p>The goal was for today to be a museum day, but we only made it half way through the first museum. And that was the <a href="http://www.moma.org/">Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)</a>. There were a lot of things that were abstract or just uninteresting (as you would expect from a modern art museum), but there were also some cool things too. One of our favorites was a video of a bunch of shots looking at a mirror and then a hammer smashing through the mirror to reveal the image on the other side. Another favorite was of a <a href="http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2015/03/26/future-couture-nervous-systems-kinematics-dress/">3D printed dress</a>. It was printed in a 2D plane, but when pulled up by the straps it forms a dress. My conclusion on the MoMA is that they presented a lot of interesting content in a very raw form. If they had made it their goal to use the art and concepts to entertain me (like the art forms in a Cirque du Soleil show) it could have been amazing, but that is probably museum heresy.</p>
                        <p>After we were kicked out of the MoMA, we decided to go to the greatest landmark in all of New York: the <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/fifthavenue/">5th Avenue Apple Store</a>. Really it is just like any Apple Store (tons of customers, people in blue shirts, and Apple Products), but the glass entrance is a nice touch.</p>
                        <p>We have been playing a game for finding places to eat where we have find a spot in a one block radius (on any of the four blocks surrounding an intersection). It rained all afternoon and evening so wanted to find something close. However, doing this from the Apple Store left us with almost exclusively fancy restaurants, but we managed to find a hole in the wall sandwich spot.</p>
                        <p>For dessert we were told we needed to get cheesecake from the best place in all of New York: <a href="http://www.twolittleredhens.com/">Two Little Red Hens</a>. I have tried a lot of cheesecakes in the last several years as a result of my Dad owning Chuckanut Bay Foods, but I would honestly say that this was the best tasting cheesecake I have ever had!</p>
                        <p>On a whim, we decided to go see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369610/">Jurassic World</a> at an IMAX movie theater. The theater allowed us to pick our own seats when buying tickets, but Tore and I accidentally bought tickets for people in a wheelchair (because they were the only remaining spots for two people to sit together). We realized our mistake when there were no chairs to sit in. We got it fixed, but sat separately. The movie was an excellent experience, but I do not think it will go down in history as a classic movie.</p>

                        <p>We keep getting up later and later... couldn't be because we go to bed later and later though...  Fortunately it was a lazy Sunday.  The plan for today was to go to church in and explore Brooklyn!  Brooklyn definitely has a different vibe that Manhattan.  It feels a lot smaller, at lot more approachable, a lot less busy, and a lot less crowded.  Well, at least the parts we were in.  I'm sure there are quite a few people commuting to/from Brooklyn every day and the bridges must get swamped, but it probably attracts a much different crowd.</p>
                        <p>We tried to take the subway to church in the morning, only to find out that on Sundays the subway didn't stop where we were waiting - so we showed up almost half an hour late to <a href="https://www.brooklyntabernacle.org/">The Brooklyn Tabernacle</a>!  To my astonishment they were still singing worship songs.  In fact, the service was about half worship songs and half message, both segments taking an hour!  I haven't been to a 2 hour church service in a long time, or maybe I haven't ever been to one that long!  I can't say the sermon was particularly strong.  The worship was much different than usual with more dancing and a massive choir, but the pastor really did not seem to deliver a profound or insightful message.  But maybe he knows his crowd - the beautiful concert hall was packed!</p>
                        <p>After church we had planned to go to Smorgasburg - a flea market that happens in Brooklyn every weekend.  Upon arriving at the park where it was supposed to be held, we discovered that it was in a different location on Saturdays than on Sundays, and we were in the Saturday location!  Another classic mistake that happens when travelling.  That brings the lessons learned today to: (1) make sure the public transit runs as expected on weekends, and (2) make sure that the place you are going to is both open AND the correct location for the current day :)</p>
                        <p>At this point we were both getting pretty hungry, so we decided to break for brunch before taking the ferry to the Brooklyn Bridge Park (where Smorgasburg is held on Sundays).  The first 2 spots we stumbled upon for brunch were an Italian restaurant and a Cuban restaurant, which appeared to hardly modify their menus for Sunday brunch.  With our hearts set on bacon and eggs, we looked a few blocks North where we found the <a href="http://fatgoosewilliamsburg.com/">Fat Goose</a>.  Simple menu, excellent service, and good food - the perfect spot to eat brunch and capture a quick timelapse of our food.</p>
                        <p>If you cant tell already, we have completely bought in to the timelapses.  Its more than a picture, yet different than a video - it seems to be the perfect way to convey traveling (unless you need sound for something).  And the ferry ride (and subsequent walk across the Brooklyn Bridge) proved to be ideal spots for timelapse footage!  We hope you have enjoyed seeing a snippet of what we see each day, because we sure think they are fun.</p>
                        <p>For dinner, we decided to venture to Little Italy to see what all the hype was about.  We went to one of the more popular pizza joints in Manhattan (and the first pizza restaurant in the US!), <a href="http://www.firstpizza.com/">Lombardi's</a>.  I would definitely say it is in my all time top 5 for pizza, but Mitch said that Tavola's pie was better (see <a href="http://mitchellaneousadventores.com/#june24">June 24 pictures</a>)!</p>
                        <p>Worn out from all the walking, we headed home for a few episodes of Parks and Recreation, and (maybe) an early bedtime.  Good night New York!</p>

                        <h2>More Museums</h2>
                        <h3>New York Day 5 | June 29, 2015</h3>
                        <p>It is starting to sound like a broken record, but I slept in until after 11 AM by which point Tore had already enjoyed a breakfast at a nearby coffee shop. We decided it would be another museum day so our first stop was the Museum of Arts and Design. We arrived to discover that it was closed so we went to the <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. The place is massive! I kid you not, I spent about an hour and a half intently reading and observing the exhibits, and then spent another hour and a half meandering around and still only saw about half of the museum before I was museumed out. One of my favorite exhibits was the European paintings. In particular, I really liked a painting of the moon shinning through the clouds onto a bay. Clearly the artist had some incredible skill at capturing the beauty of the scene. Other exhibits, like the modern art exhibit, included works that 10 ten year old could have busted out in 20 minutes and were not even cool. I think Tore is able to appreciate the fine arts a little better than me, so he enjoyed the museum a lot.</p>
                        <p>We were ready for a recharge and decided to make our way to a nearby Starbucks for a "taste of home." On the way we found a cool bagel shop. As we enjoyed our bagels, I watched an elderly lady with a walker struggle to communicate with the gentleman behind the counter (and his first language was not english) while simultaneous watching a man who was drunk or drugged, fall asleep standing up and get kicked out of the store. After the entertainment subsided and we finished our bagels, we actually went to Starbucks and got pumped up on sugar and caffine.</p>
                        <p>In Seattle, we had heard about an activity called "Escape the Room" where 2-6 people are placed in a room and they have to complete several puzzles within an hour to exit the room. There are a number of places that have different rooms to escape around New York, so we picked one to try it out! When we arrived, we discovered that no 2 person team had ever successfully escaped the space themed room we were about to enter in the hour timeframe. But we were determined that our recently earned Computer Engineering degrees were preparing us for this very moment. Sure enough, we completed the mission with 8 minutes to spare! It was a very fun activity that I look forward to doing again (maybe in Boston), and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes riddles, puzzles, etc.</p>
                        <p>We were ready for some food again, so we played the one block radius game to find a spot. We quickly located a $1 per slice pizza place. The had a deal of two slices of cheese pizza and a can of coke for $2.75 that we both went for! It was not the best pizza we have had in New York, but it was by far the best value for food we have had!</p>

                        <h2>A Place Worth Returning To</h2>
                        <h3>New York Day 6 | June 30, 2015</h3>
                        <p>I found a favorite cafe in New York.  And it only took 2 tries!  They have good coffee, great pastries, and a wonderful atmosphere.  I wish I could say its the best coffee shop in Manhattan, but I know there are too many out there for me to make that claim.  Anyway, its called Fika, and its a Swedish cafe (and yes, I have been there 2 days in a row now).  When I studied abroad in Sweden, I loved to take my Fika breaks - short breaks during the day to grab a coffee with friends and just relax.  Thats probably part of the reason I like this cafe so much - its somewhat nostalgic for me (and its fun to hear people speaking Swedish!)  I have been hoping to find a place on this trip that I would end up going to more than once, and if we had more time, I would go back more than twice.  Its fun to travel and explore all the thousands of restaurants in New York City, but I think its more fun to find a place that you like so much you don’t feel like you are missing out on those thousands of other spots because you would just rather go back.</p>
                        <p>Today was our last chance to check anything off our list, and there was one thing we had been saving for nice weather - biking through central park!  We rented a few bikes out online (huge discount for renting online - a little trip for your travelers) for 3 hours and headed to the park.  We did a lap around (a quick 10 km!) to check out the park and take some timelapse footage (what else!?).  Central Park is MASSIVE!  I am a big fan. It has a little bit of everything, especially if everything means baseball fields.  Seriously though, there are so. many. baseball diamonds!  26 to be exact!</p>
                        <p>If I lived in New York (I could definitely see it, after spending a week here), I would definitely want to be close enough to central park that I could go for a run before or after work.  We ended up doing another lap around the park for good measure, and it makes me excited for potentially biking to work next year!</p>
                        <p>Wtth nothing left on our list, we sought out a place to enjoy our remaining time in New York.  We found a spot for Happy Hour and sat out on the patio, enjoying some wings and calamari.  It was bar food, definitely not the best food in NY, but it tasted great after biking 20 km!  That seemed to really hit Mitch hard, and he was down for the count for the next few hours (napping).  So I found a bar to watch the US defeat Germany 2-0!  U-S-A!</p>
                        <p>After waking Mitch up, we headed down to get standby tickets to a comedy show.  The place was PACKED!  There was a mob outside the door - all sold out, all out of standby tickets.  So we walked back to a scalper selling tickets on the corner.  Turns out he worked for a competing comedy club.  He offered us 2 tickets foe $30, and we were intrigued.  He showed us where the place was and who would be on stage, and told us the show started in 5 minutes and we would be the first in line (red flag number 1! The other place was packed!).  While I was at the ATM, Mitch overhead someone asking about the fine print on the tickets - “Must purchase a drink inside” (Red flag #2).  As we started to say we were no longer interested, the salesman lowered his target, almost pleading with us “okay, 2 for $20” - but we were over it at that point!  I guess you could call it the wizard story (*ahem* Walker) since nothing ended up happening and we went home.  Thats all for NY!</p>

                        <h2>Lighting Strikes Twice</h2>
                        <h3>New York to Boston | July 1, 2015</h3>
                        <p>Today was an "early" morning for us. My alarm was set for 7:45 and I woke up at 7:44 (Tore's alarm at 7:30 did give me a 15 minute warning)! Our last bus ride with MegaBus from D.C. To Philly got in an accident and was generally unpleasant, so we were really hoping for a smooth 4 hour ride to Boston. However, we had no such luck; our bus had no AC. It was quite miserable. To sit up, my back had to peel away from the seat due to the sweat. The bus driver pulled over at a rest stop about half way through the trip and said we could wait for another bus, or keep going. We voted to carry onward!</p>
                        <p>We eventually made it to Boston, but I have a hard time recommending MegaBus to anyone now after having two bad experiences.</p>
                        <p>We are sharing a hotel room with Tore's parents who just so happen to be in Boston at the same time. But Tore's parents were not going to be arriving until much later. So we checked in, dropped off our bags, and searched for food. We got clam chowder (and Tore got a salad) at a nearby restaraunt on the water called Joe's. It was only 3:00 PM when we finished so we had the afternoon to kill. We decided to find out if there was another Escape the Room location in Boston. Sure enough there was! Our reservation was for 5:00, so we headed to the Boston Common and Garden to watch the ducks and kill the time.</p>
                        <p>This Escape the Room challenge (called The Cavern), was designed for more than 2 people so we were grouped up with another group of 4. It was a good thing we had help because we had only 12 seconds left on the clock when we unlocked the door! This challenge was much more difficult with multiple things to be done at a time. Supposedly, only 20% of teams escape. I am excited to do an Escape the Room challenge in Seattle with more friends!</p>
                        <p>To celebrate, Tore and I got doughnuts, Pepsi, and a slurpee. Then we went to the Apple Store (obviously) before meeting up with Tore's high school friend Natalie. We had a great time at an Asian restaurant with her and then Tore's dad Kris met up with us to go to Bova's bakery for delicious cannolis.</p>
                        <p>After we said goodbye to Natalie, the rest of us went to an Irish Pub for drinks and we listened to a live Irish band!</p>
                        <p>My only regrest for today is that it was my first Canada Day as a Canadian citizen and I did nothing to celebrate.</p>
